#Foosball slow motion instant replay

Ever wanted to relive your best foosball shots? Now you can with this project!
Featuring:
 * Automatic goal detection & score-keeping
 * Automatic instant replay (2x slow motion) of the last goal
 * Upload replays to Youtube
 * HipChat integration to send Youtube URLs and report game progress
 * Integration with a league system

See a video of it in action:

To build it you'll need
 * A foosball table ;)
 * A TV
 * A Raspberry Pi to run the UI
 * The Raspberry Pi camera module to record video
 * An arduino and some electronic components for the goal detection

You can find more info on how to build its components in the [doc folder](doc/HWSetup.md)

## Run it!

To run the UI you'll need to install a few dependencies - you can find a list of the python packages in requirements.txt.
Other dependencies you'll need on your system (raspbian packages) are: `libav-tools sox cec-utils`
Verify the default configuration in config_base.py and override it if necessary. To override config copy config.py.sample to config.py and edit it:
```
cp config.py.sample config.py
vi config.py
```

On the Raspberry Pi you can run the UI simply doing
```
python3 foos.py
```

Using X11 you can change the window size changing the scaling factor (-s 3 runs at 1/3 of the size)
```
python3 foos.py -s 3
```

Keys in X11:
 * Increment goal counter: `q, e`
 * Decrement goal counter: `z, c`
 * Ok: `s`
 * Simulate goal: `a, d`
 * Exit: `.`
